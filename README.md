# My React Github Page
I learned that we can deploy web pages made in react here on Github. Therefore, I decided to git it a try and see how it would be like to deploy such pages. While limited, I think it opens some possibilities for experimentation, and exploration, as well as a simple way to show some of your skills. 

This repo is the result of this test I went through. I left the references of the links used in the section below.
